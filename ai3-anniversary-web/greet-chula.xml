Chulalongkorn University has joined the SOI Asia since the beginning of the project. The courses provided by SOI Asia complement current courses in the faculty of engineering and faculty of science. It is the good opportunities for students and faculty members to broaden perspectives on state-of-the-art technology. On the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the project, I would like to thank the SOI Asia teams in Japan and all universities, including operators who are working behind the scene, for making the rigid platform for sharing knowledge and experience. I wish for a broader community with good understanding among countries</p>
