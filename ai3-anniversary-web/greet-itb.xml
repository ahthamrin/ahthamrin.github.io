<p>On behalf of Institut Teknologi Bandung, I would like to congratulate the Asian Internet Interconnection Initiatives (AI<sup>3</sup>) on its 10th and SOI-ASIA 5th  year anniversary.
ITB became a partner of  AI<sup>3</sup> in October 1996 following the establishment of its earth station. It was also during that time that the first National Research and Education Network (NREN) in the  country, which eventually became the Indonesian Research, Education,  and Information Network (IREN), was being conceptualized. Following various undertakings with AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia, ITB became the partner of TEIN2 (Trans-Eurasia Information Network). And in 2006, based on our experience with AI<sup>3</sup>, SOI Asia, and TEIN2, ITB together with University of Indonesia (UI), University of Gajah Mada and Institut Teknologi Sepuluh Nopember (ITS), developed the Indonesia Higher  Education network (INHERENT) , the first IREN in Indonesia.</p>

<p>These were two important milestones for the Indonesian ICT infrastructure dedicated solely for research and education. Coinciding with AI<sup>3</sup> expanding its network and looking to support the development of the various research initiatives of engineers and researchers within the Southeast Asian region by operating a satellite testbed network, ITB NET was, on the other hand, looking for support to establish the first IREN. And so in 1997-1998, ITB shared its internet resource to several universities located at Bandung, Surabaya, Malang, Solo, Bandar Lampung, Banda Aceh, Pontianak, Purwokerto, and Manado.</p>

<p>As part of AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia, ITB was able to undertake R&amp;D in leading-edge technologies and became a pioneering R&D institution in advanced network technologies in Indonesia. These included Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), Multimedia over IP Applications such as videoconferencing, Voice over IP (VoIP), Network Monitoring and Measurement Tools and Access Grid Technology, among others.
Our experience had made our team called to support the ICT System of the Indonesian Electoral in 2004.
Our continuous participation in international R&amp;D research collaborations such as the AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia will certainly provide an opportunity for the Indonesia to keep abreast of development in advance networking technologies.</p>

<p>We are privileged to be part of AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia and I would like to personally extend my sincere gratitude to Prof .Dr. Jun Murai, for his vision and leadership.</p>
<p>Again, congratulations to AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia.</p>
