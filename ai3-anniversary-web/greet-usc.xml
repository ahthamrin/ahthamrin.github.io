<p>It is with extreme pride and pleasure that I wish to express my warmest felicitations to all the partners of AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI-Asia as they celebrate the 5<sup>th</sup> Anniversary of the School on the Internet (SOI) Asia Project.
</p>
<p>
Allow me also to take this occasion to express our greatest gratitude to the team of SOI Asia for accepting our university's application to become a member of SOI Asia in addition to the original representative from the Philippines, the Department of Science and Technology-Advanced Science and Technology Institute (DOST-ASTI).   Our university is now reaping the benefits of being a member to this prestigious and highly relevant project.  We have already availed of the live lectures as well as the archived ones offered by SOI Asia.  Through the project, our staffs have been trained to effectively manage the network and the distance learning environment configuration.  Through constant communications and consultations with SOI partners, we have  been involved in curriculum development of courses to be offered in this virtual university.   These are just few examples showing that the goal of SOI Asia project to provide a higher education opportunity to everyone on the internet, that is free from organization, country, geographical, physical, and time restrictions, is indeed achievable.  The project has taught us that in a multicultural and transnational setting, the sharing and preservation of the valuable educational resources can be achieved effectively through the Internet.
</p>
<p>
We are very confident that the SOI Asia Project will continue to be very relevant to the world in the field of higher education and human resource development. It is our greatest  wish that SOI Asia will continue to vigorously pursue researches that lead to the continued  development of the virtual university and the educational system of the new age.
</p>
<p>
Our sincerest congratulations to all and our wishes for more fruitful years ahead!
