<p>&quot;Congratulations on the 5th anniversary of SOI Asia and 10th Anniversary of AI<sup>3</sup>! When I heard about SOI Asia concept in 2001, I was really excited.  I strongly felt that the project might give a big impact to future HRD and internet development in Asian region, and now I can say &quot;it was true&quot;.</p>

<p>It was a great chance for me to be involved in the SOI Asia project from the initial stage and to visit many universities all over the Asia.  It was
impressive that all of them really appreciated our concept and agreed to collaborate with us immediately. Now I am a secretariat for both SOI Asia and AI<sup>3</sup> Projects.  I am really proud of a strong partnership among project partners.  I will try my best for successful future of both projects!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I would like to congratulate AI<sup>3</sup> Project on  its 10th anniversary as well as SOI Asia
Project on its 5th anniversary.</p>

<p>I was working in NAIST when the first Ku-band satellite was established
between NAIST and ITB in 1996 October. This link establishment in collaboration
with Mr. Arman and Mr. Onno in ITB was my first experience in the operation of AI<sup>3</sup>
project. The memory still remains fresh in my mind, and it was very fascinating
for me to work together with Asian people. The other Ku-band partners and the new
C-band partners are eventually connected to AI<sup>3</sup> network in the following
years, although Asian countries had been confronted with Asian Economics Crisis
around 1998. I think we could not get over this crisis without many efforts in
each parter site to sustain the project.</p>

<p>AI<sup>3</sup> Project gave me great pleasure to share our project objectives and achievements,
and also gave me the valuable opportunities from the both research and operation
sides. In addition, I must to add that I owe my Ph.D. entirely to AI<sup>3</sup> Project and
all of AI<sup>3</sup> members.</p>

<p>Finally, I am really proud of joining  you in this project and wishing every
further success in the next decade for AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia project.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;AI<sup>3</sup> was a great technical opportunity. I would not have started using
videoconferencing technologies ten years ago if it was not for
broadcasting events over the satellite network; at that time, standard
were emerging, tools were not as sophisticated as they are today and
it was challenging to have to make heterogeneous configurations work
together. I would neither have learned few things about satellite
technology, communication, signal encoding and transmission: satellite
engineers do not speak the same language as computer engineers, we had
to understand each others, to adapt on both side.</p>
<p>But the greatest opportunity, from my own point of view, is definitely
to be able to work with colleagues coming from so many different
countries. My case is uncommon among AI<sup>3</sup> partners: I am not a national
from the country where I work. Even more, I am working in a
multi-national institution. I can appreciate fully the benefit of
knowing peoples from different cultures, different habits, different
ways of seeing and understanding life and I think that working
together, having to design, to build and to maintain a common project
is one of the ways that helps to understand others, to unite people.
For that invaluable human experience, I should thank all my friends at
AI<sup>3</sup>.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I involved to AI<sup>3</sup> project when it started in SFC.
At that time, I was just 21 years old graduate student, and very interested in connecting to foreign countries directly.
Actually developping such large scale network was really fun for me,  and this project gave me chances to learn a lot of things.
About the satellite and internet tecnologies, connectivities and routings at research networks, 
the real scale of the internet and human communications, and lives and enjoyments in other countries at times.
I'm really happy to have 10th Anniversary of AI<sup>3</sup> and 5th anniversary of SOI Asia.
Thanks a lot for very nice relationships between us over these years.
This history is a result of massive co-operations by a lot of researchers, engineers and students in asia,
and I hope we can help each other in various stages in the days ahead coutinually.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;First time I involved to AI<sup>3</sup> project was during my AIT's master thesis work in year 2000 using AI<sup>3</sup> cache bone as a testbed, I was impressed by full assistance from staff at NAIST who provided necessary resources to conduct experiments and their guidance to a beginner like me, finally I graduated with this work accomplished. Since then, I have worked closely with AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia project, it has been an enjoyable opportunity to work in multi-cultural environment in which many Asian institutes fully collaborate for Internet/E-learning research/operation and human resource development in the region.  Through this project, in educational aspect I have developed my research and operation skills in advanced Internet and applications, in social aspect I have experienced International community and new countries/people/cultures, and last I have influenced by the sincere contribution of this project to the society.</p>
<p>In this 10th Anniversary of AI<sup>3</sup> and 5th anniversary of SOI Asia project, I would like to congratulate to the project for its remarkable achievement and I wish the continuous success to bring new challenging opportunities to Asia.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been involved in AI<sup>3</sup> since it started at ITB, and I think I virtually grow with this project. I was the student who had just awaken in AI<sup>3</sup>-ITB NOC when Prof. Suguru Yamaguchi visited it in October 1996. Now I have a Ph.D. degree under the supervision of Prof. Jun Murai, and the topic was from AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia projects. So I thank the AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia projects for it.</p>
<p>Over these years, I believe we have not only doing research and connecting institutions in Asia to the Internet, but also developing friendships and understanding among us, fellow members of these projects. And we value these for all our lives.</p>
<p>The challenges today are very much different compared to ten or five years ago. We must change to continue our success. May we have another ten years, at least, in the future.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I have been with SOI (School on the Internet) project since 1997, when I entered the Keio University undergraduate school.  Since then, I have been working/conducting research in the project.  I was very impressed with the idea of doing lectures through the Internet, and thought this could be a good method to share educational resources worldwide with other countries as regular basis for human resource development, because I believed continuous educational collaboration is the only way to really develop human resources.  My dream came true when we started the SOI Asia project in 2001, and started to share the university level courses with universities in other Asian countries.  Evaluation on the educational meanings is very difficult, and some say that we can evaluate the education meanings only after 10 years, when the educated people grow and look back the past.  I wish our project would be looked back as a worthwhile educational project.  To realize this, I wish that SOI Asia project would continue for many coming years to share more educational resources within Asia, and I believe our 5th anniversary is just a starting point.  I would like to thank you to AI<sup>3</sup> Project for offering the Internet infrastructure for SOI Asia project, and send sincere congratulations for it's 10 year anniversary.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In the beginning of establishing our Receive-Only (RO) site in January 2002, I and my colleagues  in Brawijaya University (UB)  were very new the UDL technology brought by SFC team. We were learnt lots of knowledge and got broader view by operating our site and exploring with several events dedicated to SOI Asia at that time, while the active members of this group was a very few.</p>
<p>It's been 4 years since I have been involved to participate in SOI Asia Project and within those periods then I also have been introduced to AI<sup>3</sup> Project when our site had established in 2005. AI<sup>3</sup> Project and SOI Asia Project has created a big milestone in developing this Asian region with development and implementation of advanced technologies to break the &quot;digital divide&quot;, thus it emerged big community as it is.</p>

<p>In this year 2006, I've been given the opportunities by this project to continue my study in SFC. I hope, I can fulfill and tint this community and continuing the successfulness in future. I would like to express my thanks to the AI3 and SOI Asia Project for giving me many opportunities to participate in.</p>
<p>Happy 10<sup>th</sup> Anniversary AI<sup>3</sup> and 5<sup>th</sup> Anniversary SOI Asia!!!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It is a great honor for us to reach the tenth anniversary of the AI<sup>3</sup>
Project together. The last decade has seen the AI<sup>3</sup> Project team endeavor
to develop an Internet infrastructure for Asian countries with
satellite-based networking technology. Through such development, we have
succeeded in providing Internet access to a broad swathe of Asia. The
AI<sup>3</sup> Project's activities have contributed to not only the deployment of
infrastructure but also to creating and improving human relationships in
the Asian region.</p>
<p>Recently, since the infrastructure on the ground has been developed, the
role of satellite network has begun to change. In the next decade of the
AI<sup>3</sup> Project, new types of research fields will emerge, such as
broadcasting using Internet technology via satellite links that features
broadcasting availability as its media characteristic, as well as the
capability to construct infrastructure technology in emergency
situations. Furthermore, we are expecting that it is human relationships,
which have been created within the AI<sup>3</sup> Project over the last decade,
that will spur on future research and development activities in the
Asian region.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;For years of being one of SOI Asia partners, Brawijaya University has been experiencing a huge progress in developing Information Technology infrastructure and operating a distance learning.  Due to valuable supports and good guidances from SOI, Brawijaya University can not only establish and implement an advanced networking, but the university can also hold distance lecturers for some faculties in Brawijaya University directly given by lecturers from Japan. More over, Brawijaya University were offered to have a high-quality human resources in understanding IT by regularly joining the SOI Asia workshops and meetings. The other benefit is that this university has been in a broader communities of various Asian countries. This may lead to good relationship and cooperation between the countries to develop IT together and later may hold distance lectures from the countries instead of Japan.</p>
<p>Further more after joining AI<sup>3</sup>, the staffs of Brawijaya University have more priceless collaboration on building the Asian IT network, such as implementing IPv6 and its features in well manners. 
Lastly, we would like to thank to SOI Asia Project and AI<sup>3</sup> which have given us opportunity and well supports to develop the IT. We also deliver our thanks to Japan's staffs who always offer a prominent help to have a better understandings in IT and facilitate Asian countries to establish an educational network and good cooperation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We are SOI Asia E-Learning operators of UCSY, Myanmar. First of all, may we say thank you very much indeed for your contributions and invaluable continued supports to UCSY through SOI project since 2001.This SOI project has been and is still very beneficial to our Ph. D. program of UCSY and biotechnology students of YTU. Your contributions to UCSY are very remarkable and appreciated by all of us .Without this SOI project and your supports, we would not have achieved what we have achieved now.</p>
<p>As our E-Learning operators, we got many benefits from SOI Asia Operator Workshop Training. SOI Asia E-Learning Project is very beneficial for our research. So, we would like to say thank you again for your support and kindness to us. And there were significant events between UCSY and Keio University. It was when you conducted   a video conference at UCSY on the ceremony of 30th anniversary of ASEAN + 3. UCSY felt that we were greatly honored for the event. Since then the standard   of ICT in Myanmar has been well recognized among ASEAN countries.</p>
<p>We got many advantages from SOI Asia E-Learning Project: to produce more experts who have the practical ability to invent, install, experiment with, and apply computer hardware and software with a view to making Myanmar a modern and develop nation and foster the outstanding products of the University to become high caliber experts, to conduct research contributing to the welfare of the nation and to carry out research and development activities on Information Technology utilizing the high caliber experts and to make the use of computer proliferate all over the country. By making e-Learning readily available via the internet, intranet, or CD, learners can schedule training so that it does not interfere with other responsibilities. Learners also do not have to travel to a distant training site, resulting in decreased travel costs per learner and additional time savings.</p> 
<p>As E-Learning possibilities are endless, the benefits are clear: Information is consolidated; training is faster, easier, and more productive. We believe that our collaboration and cooperation will be sustainable forever.&quot;</p>

The contribution will help partners to perform their jobs better and more efficiently indeed. Personally, since the beginning the workshop was very interesting. The result was what I had expected. Thus, it was a step to reach to higher level of academic education which we are able to decrease the technological gap and to exchange experiences. Obviously it was my great opportunity and I would like to involve more in upcoming future workshop as well as pushing Cambodian students to join real time class.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I am very much grateful to SOI project committee that I got a chance to become SOI operator from TU. The technology, concept and vision of AI<sup>3</sup>, SOI is clear as far as I know. Our responsibility is to enhance new technology in our under developing country with the help of internet education. Because internet and information is synonymous. I found this project and its concept is great to make the globe to be reached any where easily. I make university students aware about the new technologies. Really I appreciate the knowledge of our SFC teachers and their confidence. First of all, when I joined to SOI Global E-workshop, I found myself that i was somewhere in the new world. I got opportunity to enhance my knowledge on UNIX networking and especially on IPv6 Networking. In the future, I think SOI should enhance this system to provide university degree online. Keep this project running and extend the technology.

Honestly, in all of the ups and downs we endure, the relationship we build is strengthened and cherished, things that will not fade in my memory, and I hope in ours too. There is more to come in the future, I hope, new challenges and new experiences.</p>
<p>Perhaps someday this project will interconnect more and more enthusiast people all around the world. After all, we are only seperated by wires and antennas. Even if we do not achieve the summit of our goal, the process of achieving itself is something precious, especially for me.
