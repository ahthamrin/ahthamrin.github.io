<br/>Chairman of Board, Asia SEED</p>

<p>On behalf of Asia SEED, I would extend my heartfelt congratulations to 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary of SOI Asia project and 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of AI<sup>3</sup> project.
</p>
<p>
It is honorable for us to be involved in SOI Asia from the initial stage and now to serve as a secretariat both for SOI Asia and AI<sup>3</sup> project.
</p>
<p>
We, Asia SEED, believe that human resource development is a key to the sustainable development for the Asian region. Academic exchanges among the region would contribute to share knowledge scattering in many countries.  Under these concepts, we have implemented various human resource development projects such as university upgrading programs, preparatory education before going to Japan, twining program with Japanese universities and so on since 1984.
</p>
<p>
Experiences thorough the projects bring us the new visions for human resource development project.  E-learning system and network technologies developed by SOI Asia and AI<sup>3</sup> projects definitely show us the new collaboration model among universities and research institutes.  If the conventional ways of collaboration can be combined with network and digital technologies, it is possible to share various educational resources and research outcomes in the region more effectively.  It enables to minimize the digital divide and to provide equal opportunity to access knowledge.
</p>
<p>
Asia SEED assumes that its principal mission is to act as a catalyst, a bridge for the projects to find educational resources available and match Asia's needs.  As one of the secretariat, we engage to make every possible effort for further achievements of SOI Asia and AI<sup>3</sup> projects.
</p>
<p>
Finally, we wish all AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI Asia partners and supporting organizations' great success in the future.
