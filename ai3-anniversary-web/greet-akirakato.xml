<p>I would like to express my congratulation to those who have related to
this AI<sup>3</sup> Project for its 10th anniversary. It was not an easy task to
set up just a couple of VSAT stations to establish an IP link between
two countries -- people may needed to work hard for large diversity of
problems from physical installation of the stations to the license
negotiation with their governments.</p>

<p>Furtheremore AI<sup>3</sup> group performed outstanding work to extend the
infrastructure to cover other countries, enlarging its foot print and
the community. Meanwhile people were educated by themselves to
contribute statble operation as well as made the infrastructure as a
testbed to the new technologies including UDLR, IPv6 unicast, and IPv6
multicast. While it experienced some minor glitches, the
infrastructre has been operated reliably so that many students and
faculties received the benefits.</p>

<p>It is a good moment to reconsider the role of satellite link and AI<sup>3</sup>
among the current Internet environment for next few years. While the
network of people will be more important to expand the community, the operational strategies may need to be re-evaluated with the
terrestrial infrastucture which has been deployed in some
few countries in order to provide a better and efficient environment.

I wish the AI<sup>3</sup> group will keep the current activities in both hands
for other success for the next decade.</p>
