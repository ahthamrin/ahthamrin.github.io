<h1 class="title">Asian Internet Interconnection Initiatives (AI<sup>3</sup>)</h1>
<p>Asian Internet Interconnection Initiatives is an international research consortium among research institutes in Asian region and is aiming to form a group of researchers to develop leading edge technologies for the Internet, such as IPv6, multicast, unidirectional links, WWW caching and replication mechanisms, multimedia communication mechanism, and applications for the advanced usage of the Internet. AI<sup>3</sup> Project was kicked-off in October 1995 by <a href="http://www.wide.ad.jp/" title="Widely Integrated Distributed Environment">WIDE Project</a> and <a href="http://www.jsat.net/" title="JSAT Corp.">JSAT Corp</a>.</p>
<p>AI<sup>3</sup> Project is running a satellite Internet test-bed network in Asia. It started with three bidirectional links on Ku-band, and after several changes, the test-bed network is now consisted of eight bidirectional links and a unidirectional link on C-band. Besides the above mentioned actitivites, AI<sup>3</sup> Project also serves as the network insfrastructure  for SOI Asia Project.</p>

<h1 class="title">School on the Internet Asia (SOI Asia)</h1>
<p>SOI ASIA Project is launched in 2001 by <a href="http://www.wide.ad.jp/" title="Widely Integrated Distributed Environment">WIDE Project</a>. SOI Asia Project utilizes satellite based Internet to provide Internet environments in a less expensive, easy to deploy, and more feasible way for the universities located in the regions where Internet environments are insufficiently developed; conducts research and development of the necessary technology for IT human resource development in Asia while using the environments; and proposes, through field experiments, a new educational methodology for universities in Japan as well as educational institutions abroad.</p>
<p>As of October 2006, the project has twenty-two partner universities and research institutes in twelve countries in Asia, and has deployed receive-only satellite earth stations at each partner site to share the distribution of live lectures from various part of the world as well as archived lectures.</p>

<p>This project is supported by several ministries of Japanese government, and ran mainly by WIDE Project, AI<sup>3</sup> Project, Keio University, Asia SEED and JSAT Corp. The official lecture providing partners include Tokyo University of Fisheries and Marine Science, Agricultural Department of Tohoku University, Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology, Keio University, and WIDE Project.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Network and Applications</h2>
<img align="right" hspace="5px" vspace="5px" src="images/soi-asia-netconfig.gif" alt="SOI Asia Network" width="400" height="300" />
<p>SOI Asia network has three components: lecturer sites, a gateway site, and student sites. Lecturer sites can be built anywhere as long as the network bandwidth is sufficient to carry lecture video and audio to the gateway site. The gateway site is located in Keio University, Shonan Fujisawa Campus, the location of the AI3 C-band hub station. Students sites are located in Asia, within the footprint of the JCSAT-3 satellite used by AI3 Project.</p>
<p>Student sites have Receive Only earth stations to receive data transmitted to the AI3 Unidirectional Link. These sites also have Internet connections, such as 128kbps leased-line, for the return traffic from the student sites. Using a satellite unidirectional link enable us to deliver good quality video and audio to student sites, while the existing Internet connections enable real-time interactions between lecturers and students. Student sites also have mirror servers so students can watch lecture archives from local servers.</p>
<p>We use  <abbr title="Digital Video Transport System">DVTS</abbr> or Polycom to connect a lecturer site to the gateway site, and Windows Media Player or <abbr title="VIdeo Conference Tool">VIC</abbr>/<abbr title="Robust Audio Tool">RAT</abbr> for delivering classes from the gateway site to student sites. We use various  applications such as VIC/RAT, Internet Relay Chat, Bulletin Board, MSN  Messenger for the feedback from a student site to the lecturer site. The  student site can decide which application they will use based on their Internet  infrastructure.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Human Resource Development Programs</h2>
<p>We believe that a stable environment  management by each local staff with sufficient understanding of the  network/distance learning environment configuration and knowledge for network  management is indispensable for lecture operations and our project's future development. To meet this, we have orgnized SOI Asia operator's  workshop since 2002.  We invited about 30  local site operators to the workshops, and teach the basic and advanced  knowledge to maintain our system.  In  August 2006, SOI Asia organized a <em>Global E-Workshop</em>.  42 operators from 19 organizations in 10  countries participated in the workshop remotely utilizing SOI Asia network and  technologies.</p>
<p>We also have “SOI Asia Human  Resource Development Program (internship program)” since January 2006 to invite  Asian operators to Keio University 3 months for the On-the-job training.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Partnership with Universities and Curriculum</h2>
<p>We manage our project through  steering committee, which consists of each partner's representative, academic  committee and operator committee. In the academic committee, we gather each  university's course wish lists, and decide the curriculum. In the year 2005, we  conducted marine science, bio-technology, information technology and disaster  management courses, which received the most requests from the partner universities.  We are also in the process of constructing a system for  grade exchange and review the way of faculty communication and grading for the  students. In the steering committee, we established organized partnerships by  discussing various processes such as new site approval process.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Past Achievement</h2>
<img src="images/soi-asia-antenna-ucsy.jpg" alt="SOI Asia class" width="200" height="150" hspace="5" vspace="5" align="right" />
<p>Through our project, we already  established Internet infrastructure in twenty-two partners in twelve countries  in low cost and short span. Especially in Union of Myanmar, none of the  universities have Internet infrastructure in October 2001, when our project had  started, and Internet was not managed commercially. However, in those times, we  installed Internet connection in University  of Computer Science, Yangon,  and got special permit from the government to use the Internet connection  freely for educational purpose, and established student site environment. </p>
<p>Through our distance learning  environment, we have delivered 105 lectures and 11 courses until September 2006.  In these lecture series, there were not only  Internet technology related lectures, but also marine science lectures by Tokyo  University of Marine Science and Technology, and Bio-technology lectures by Tohoku University.  We confirmed our accumulation of distance learning experience in Internet  related lecture can be applied to other courses.</p>
<p>We also confirmed the communication  system of student and lecturer through our distance-learning environment;  students attend the lecture, students submit the assignments, and lecturer  reviews the assignment, can work well to the universities, which have matching  interest. Students can specify the lecturer of their interest, and the lecturer  could review the abilities of the students. We found our distance learning  procedure could be applied to the selection of co-advisors, educational programs  such as lectures from joint research partners. </p>
<p>We use our network with partner  organizations as a “platform for dialogues” on regional key issues.  We implemented real-time symposium in various  topics time to time.  After the Indian  Ocean Tsunami, SOI Asia had a special symposium to discuss roles of  universities on disaster prevention.   Based on the discussion, SOI Asia presented Tsunami related lectures and  invited Syiah Kuala  University, Banda Ache, Indonesia-  a university seriously damaged by Tsunami.</p>
<h2 class="subtitle">Future works</h2>
<p>We will conduct several lecture  series with inter-university grade exchanges and verify if our environment is  suitable for real university level lecture infrastructure. We will also apply  our environment to exchange student programs and twining programs to propose more  efficient educational programs.</p>
