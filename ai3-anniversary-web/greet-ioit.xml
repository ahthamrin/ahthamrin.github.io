<p>
It is my great pleasure to convey the greetings of Institute of Information Technology (IOIT) to all colleagues and friends in AI<sup>3</sup>-SOI community.

<p>
IOIT, belonging to Vietnamese Academy of Science and Technology (VAST), was founded in 1976 with the mission of  research and development of IT in Vietnam.

As an Internet technology pioneer in Vietnam IOIT introduced Internet into Vietnam in early 90s, and joined AI<sup>3</sup> in 1996.  From December 1998 IOIT officially became a full member of AI<sup>3</sup>, with the Decision of the Government of Vietnam (Decision No 1122/QD-TTg) to grant IOIT to carry out the AI<sup>3</sup>-VN project.

10 years have past since early days of AI<sup>3</sup>, IOIT has enjoyed not only helpful support and co-operation from Japanese and ASEAN colleagues but also an enduring multinational friendship which is very unique in international co-operation.
