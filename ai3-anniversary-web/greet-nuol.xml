<br/>Vice-President, National University of Laos</p>

<p>On the occasion of the fifth anniversary of the School on Internet - Asia (SOI-Asia) Project celebration, please allow me to warmly convey my sincere and thoughtful congratulation on behalf of the National University of Laos as well as the member of the project and also myself to the President, to the Board Trustees Committee as of to all our colleagues.
</p>
<p>
In the era of globalization; the higher education needs to be redesigned, the higher education institutions need to be networking, the educators, scholars, students, need to meet each other. The cooperation among members of the SOI-Asia project is indeed imperative.
</p>
<p>
As all of us know the initiative of the School on Internet - Asia (SOI-Asia) Project is to promote multilateral networking regionally and internationally between universities and other institutions of higher education in Asia but also global where the higher education professionals have opportunity to share experiences and information.
</p>
<p>
As a member of the project, we are delighted to know that within this half decade (2002-2006), the project has gradually grown with a large numbers of academic members and quality of the activities has also been improved. This extensive academic development has been resulting in much benefit to all the project members including the National University of Laos.
</p>
<p>
May I take this opportunity to report what the National University of Laos has been benefited from SOI-Asia Project since the Faculty of Engineering has become the member of the project. It is noted that the National University of Laos has got: </p>
<ol>
 <li>The installation of server for the up link and down link information connecting to the project members, </li>
 <li>Improving Management of information and,</li>
 <li>Human Resources Development. </li>
</ol>
<p>
We are definitely sure that Human Resource Development is the core factor of the benefit. Beyond this, our staff and students have had the opportunity to be trained and to improve their knowledge in terms of technological capacity building and institutional sustainability. Moreover, we also have got financial assistance from the project to foster teaching and learning capacity throughout the internet program. This grant is very crucial and very helpful in that it contributes greatly to the Development of Human Resources at the National University of Laos, which is one of the eight top priorities of the Lao Government Policy. That is to respond to the poverty eradication in the country within the year 2020.
</p>
<p>
This contribution will not only bring in about the accessibility to the world wide information among our staff but also providing opportunity for our staff to get access to training in various disciplines via the distance learning system. One of the most significant activities that can be highlighted in this forum is that the National University of Laos has chance to collaborate, share experiences and extend its relationship with many universities in the ASEAN countries as well as the rest of the world. For example, we have built very good relationships with Keio University which is one of the most prestigious universities of Japan.
</p>
<p>
The leaders of the National University of Laos are much delighted with the successes of the SOI-Asia project and acknowledge this to our utmost achievement. We are confident that the project will continue to its best and be successful to bring benefits to all the members.
</p>
<p>
May I take this opportunity to express our deepest gratitude and appreciation to the President, the Project Board Trustees Committee, as well as university members for all of your efforts, contribution and support to the project achievement. Our appreciation also goes directly to the project Board Trustees Committee and all involving organizations that support the National University of Laos in fulfilling its task to develop its Human Resources for the Lao nation.
</p>
<p>
In this regard, please allow me to wish the SOI-Asia Project a great success, and that the collaboration will continue to develop with fruitful and effective outputs and outcomes.
</p>
<p>Thank you.
