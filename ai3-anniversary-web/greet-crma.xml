<p>On the occasion of the 5th anniversary of the School on the Internet (SOI) Asia Project, we would like to express our deepest gratitude to all those who have contributed to its success over the years.  SOI Asia provides Internet environments for the academies located in the region utilizing satellite based Internet. This gives us a great opportunity to improve the quality of education and research. Students in CRMA are benefited through the interactive discussion and by attending different programs broadcasted by SOI Asia.
