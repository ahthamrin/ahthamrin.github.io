I have learned that SOI-Asia Project has had tremendous contribution to enhance knowledge and skill of students and academic staffs of Hasanuddin University on various disciplines. The SOI-Asia Project has broadened the horizon of student and academic staff on the application of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT).

I strongly believe that AI<sup>3</sup> and SOI-Asia Project have had generated invaluable benefits to all the partners.
