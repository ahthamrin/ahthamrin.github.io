<p>I would like to offer my sincere congratulations on the 5<sup>th</sup> anniversary of SOI Asia and 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of AI3 Project.
</p>
<p>
In 2001, SOI Asia project was launched aiming at contributing to higher education in Asian region by effectively using the internet and digital technologies.  SOI Asia project has successfully developed both internet link and tight human network among the partners.
</p>
<p>
In the past 5 years, to answer all sorts of needs in the Asian region, the contents that SOI Asia has provided, varies from state-of-arts Science and Technology to Social Sciences.  In addition, SOI Asia implemented real-time symposium time to time to supply a platform for dialogues on regional key issues.  Soon after the Indian Ocean Tsunami, SOI Asia had an international symposium to discuss roles of universities on disaster prevention, presented Tsunami related lectures and extended support to Syiah Kuala University in Banda Aceh.
</p>
<p>
SOI Asia Project expanded from 8 partners in 5 countries to 22 partners in 12 countries during 2001 to 2006.  This fact shows that SOI Asia's activities are widely recognized and appreciated in Asian region.  I believe that SOI Asia keep up playing an important role in the region.
</p>
<p>
Again, congratulations on the 5th anniversary of SOI Asia and best wishes for all partners' continued success!
