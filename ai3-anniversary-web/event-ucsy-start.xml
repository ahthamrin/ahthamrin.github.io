<p>The University  of Computer Studies, Yangon, Union of Myanmar, had no Internet infrastructure until October 2001. Also Internet was not managed commercially. We started joining SOI project at the end of the year 2001. After establishing with the SOI Project, they supported to install Internet connection in our university, and got special permission from the government to use the Internet connection freely for educational purposes, and establish student site environment.</p>
<p>Also the Video Conference was conducted on 20 February 2003 by the University of Computer Studies, Yangon (UCSY) of Myanmar, Keio University from Japan and AIT. It was part of the ASEAN-Japan Exchange Year 2003, a project initiated by Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi of Japan during his visit to Southeast Asian countries. Through the cooperation of the Embassy of Japan in Myanmar, this commemoration program used the SOI-Asia network. The commemoration program featured a real-time discussion between young people of Myanmar and other ASEAN countries to present their views on how IT can assist in the development of human resources and the creation of a human network which means the &quot;sharing of technologies and ideas in ASEAN region&quot;. UCSY, where the first academic Internet connection in Myanmar has been made by SOI-Asia, and provided Transmission Station for the conference. Prof. Jun Murai, Chairman of SOI-Asia, and Professor of Keio University, Japan, chaired the event.</p>
<p>Since 2001, UCSY has cooperated with the SOI Asia Project and got involved in every activity such as meeting, workshop and distance learning, etc. SOI Asia project manages through the steering committee, which consists of each partner's representative, academic committee and operator committee. In the academic committee meeting, we can make each university's course wish list, discuss student/campus schedule and decide the curriculum. We can make discussions about operators wish, local site problems and new site proposal. In the operator committee meeting, operators can know about SOI Asia system update status such as new hardware and software installation, new site policy, academic course development, operator site update, operator workshops.</p>
<p>SOI Asia Project provided SOI Asia operator's workshop in the summer of 2002, the winter of 2003, the summer of 2004 and the summer of 2005. Our university was represented by 3 operators in summer of 2002, 3 operators in winter of 2003, 3 operators in summer of 2004 and 4 operators in summer of 2005. By providing workshop experience, our local staffs have got sufficient understanding of the networking environment and knowledge of network management. Then they distributed their knowledge to other staff and students.</p>
<p>SOI Asia Project contributed to the higher education development in UCSY through the utilization of Internet. The program of study in UCSY covered the diversified range starting from computer application courses to doctorial research. Topics such as Bio Informatics, Internet Technologies, Network Security and Software Engineering are covered. Students from our university attend the lecture, students can submit the assignments, and lecturer reviews the assignment and if they have any problem, they can ask the lecturer via BBS or RAT which have matching interest. Students can specify the lecturer of their interest, and the lecturer could review the abilities of the students. We found that SOI distance learning procedure could be applied to the selection of Co-Advisor, educational programs such as lectures from joint research partners. Now we have a plan to establish a new site UCSM (University of Computer Studies, Mandalay) which is situated in the middle part of Myanmar.</p>
