<p>On behalf of the Advanced Science and Technology Institute (ASTI), and the Department of Science and Technology (DOST), I would like to congratulate the Asian Internet Interconnection Initiatives (AI<sup>3</sup>) on its 10<sup>th</sup> year anniversary!
</p>
<p>
ASTI became a partner of the AI<sup>3</sup> in August 1999. It was also during this time that the first National Research and Education Network (NREN) in the country, which eventually became the Philippine Research, Education, and Government Information Network (PREGINET), was being conceptualized. These were two important milestones for the Philippines' ICT infrastructure dedicated solely for research and education. Coinciding with AI<sup>3</sup> expanding its network and looking to support the development of the various research initiatives of engineers and researchers within the Southeast Asian region by operating a satellite testbed network, ASTI-PREGINET was, on the other hand, looking for support to establish the first NREN. And so in March 2000, ASTI became part of the AI<sup>3</sup> network and established its earth station. 
</p>
<p>
As part of AI<sup>3</sup>, ASTI was able to undertake R&amp;D in leading-edge technologies and became a pioneering R&amp;D institution in advanced network technologies in the Philippines. These included Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6); Multimedia over IP Applications such as videoconferencing, Voice over IP; Network Monitoring and Measurement Tools; and Access Grid Technology, among others.
</p>
<p>
As the main government R&amp;D institute for ICT and Microelectronics, ASTI continues to be a leader in the development of technologies and applications for the benefit of the research and education community in the country. Our continued participation in international R&amp;E research collaborations such as the AI<sup>3</sup> will provide an opportunity for the Philippines to keep abreast of developments in advanced networking technologies.
</p>
<p>
We are privileged to be part of AI<sup>3</sup>, and I would like to personally extend my gratitude to Dr. Jun Murai, for his vision and leadership. Again, congratulations to AI<sup>3</sup>!
