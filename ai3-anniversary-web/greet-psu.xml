<p>It is the good time to delivery our congratulations to the celebrations of the 10<sup>th</sup> anniversary of Asian Internet Interconnection Initiatives (AI<sup>3</sup>) Project and the 5<sup>th</sup> of the School on the Internet (SOI) Asia Project in the year 2006.

<p>
Prince of Songkla University (PSU), Thailand, has officially joint the SOI-Asia project on September 2, 2004. We are one of four sites established in Thailand. This gives us the opportunity to be a member of one of the most pioneer group, lead by Prof. Jun Murai and WIDE Project, on distance learning based on Internet satellite technology. The SOI Asia has brought the knowledge transfer and exchange to benefit all members, especially on human development, via this learning technology. The knowledge is not only in ICT domain but also in other important domains requested by members. All members have shown and shared their generous spirit working together on this project. Thanks to SOI Asia Project team for their supporting and hard working. Our big thanks also go to the contribution of WIDE Project and AI<sup>3</sup> Project who make this activity possible.
</p>
<p>
Once again, congratulations to a big success of SOI Asia Project. We do hope that this friendly community will gradually grow up happily to achieve the target goals.
</p>
<p>
Thank you.
